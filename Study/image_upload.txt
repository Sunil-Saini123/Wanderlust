# So for image upload :

1. We need manipulate our form so that it can take images
2. We generally do no store images like files in database because mongodb has certain limits . So for this we can use 3rd party storage.
3. the 3rd storage will give us url for that image and that we will store in our database.


for form :

we need to write " enctype = "multipart/form-data"    "
and also need to use a package multer and initialize it.

and also a middleware upload.single("name")
