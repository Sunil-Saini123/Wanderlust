// cookies :

what ?

Web cookies are small text files that websites store on a user's computer or device to track browsing activity,
personalize the user experience, and remember information. They are an integral part of the internet, allowing websites
to remember user preferences, maintain login sessions, and track website usage. 

how ?

When a user visits a website, the server can send a cookie to the user's browser. 
The browser stores the cookie and sends it back to the server with subsequent requests. 

res.cookie(name_of_cookie, value_of_cookie);

About ?

cookies are stored inside the "req"
but if we access the "req.cookies" it will give undefined

Soln ? 

we use a middleware called "cooki-parser"
cooki_parser = require("cookie-parser");
app.use(cookie_parser());

then we can access the cookie


// Signed Cookies 

we use signed cookies so that we know that if there is tampering( chedchad ) with cookie or not

app.use(cookie_parser("secretcode"));   --- we use some secretcode 

// send side
res.cookie("cooki-info","cookie-value",{signed:true});


// on recieve to verify 

console.log(req.signedCookies)   -- if this is null ( {} )  or false means there is tempering with cookie

[ we use req.cookies -- for unsigned and req.signedCookies for signed ]
